    <h3 class="title_h3">Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.</li> 
        <li>Pat dry zucchini slices with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ground beef; cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add marinara sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, and pepper; simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Arrange one layer of zucchini slices in the prepared baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the sauce. Add another layer of zucchini slices. Spread ricotta mixture on top. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Add another layer of zucchini slices; cover with remaining sauce and top with remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until top is golden, about 15 minutes more.</li>
